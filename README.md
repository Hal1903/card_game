# card_game
Rule:
1. Click to pick a card
2. Compare your card and Opponent's card, and whoever picked higher value is winner in the round
3. Picked card will be lost in the game
4. After you picked all the cards, whoever won more round is winner in the game.
5. Next round will begin soon, and all the cards will be restored.

Compulsive project.

I am aware of how messy are my codes, but also aware of how to solve them. However, because modifying all those codes is troublesome, so I leave them.
3days to learn from TechWithTim during last summer vacation, and a day to complete this project on Jan. 7.
No designing and no other screen. If I feel to add them, I will do them.






(Next project would be 3D or data science. Maybe data science -- 3D seemed excited but not as much as I expected... sorry, for my friend who helped me a lot for 3D game development.)
